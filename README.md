### Lessons Learned
* The four of us were pretty excited about things during the planning phase and we made a database that reflected that excitement. The size of our database and the relations between the tables quickly became complicated to navigate successfully. Unfortunately, we had to move a few tables into the stretch goals section. Start small and build out as needed.
* Set the project up in a way that provides for an equal-ish distribution of labor. One way to do this is split the controller into a few different files, allowing more people to work on it without merge conflicts.

### Stretch Goals
* Search parks by geo-feature, wildlife, and visitor type.
* Google Maps Integration.
* Share trips via social media.
* Leave comments for trips and parks.
* Printer-friendly view.

#### Icebox
* Content for the activities, wildlife, and geo-features tables that accurately reflects the diversity of the parks.
* Predictive autocomplete in the search fields.
* Review trips and parks.
* Expansion of park scope to include more than US National Parks.
